# E15B-final-project

This project uses the concept of persistence of vision to display letters and symbols. There is a full report on how it works and what it is made from 
in the project report. Note that I only created 2D arrays for a couple of letters and symbols. You can create your own additional 
letters and symbols if you decide to create the project yourself.
